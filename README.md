# Logistic Regression Model with Scikit-learn
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Logistic Regression model for classification tasks using the popular Python library scikit-learn.

## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a statistical model used to estimate the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, pass/fail, 0/1) based on one or more predictor variables. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm, not a regression one. It works by fitting a special S-shaped curve called the sigmoid function to the data. This function maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

## Key Features
Binary Classification: Ideal for problems where the output is a discrete binary variable.

Probabilistic Output: Provides a probability score for each class, which can be useful for decision-making.

Simple and Interpretable: The model's coefficients can be easily interpreted to understand the relationship between the features and the outcome.

Efficient: It's computationally inexpensive and fast to train, especially on large datasets.

## Scikit-learn Implementation
Scikit-learn provides a robust and easy-to-use LogisticRegression class. A typical workflow involves these steps:

Import: Import the LogisticRegression class from sklearn.linear_model.

Instantiate: Create an instance of the model, optionally specifying hyperparameters like penalty, C, or solver.

Train: Use the .fit() method to train the model on your training data (features and target labels).

Predict: Use the .predict() method to make class predictions on new data.

Evaluate: Use various metrics from sklearn.metrics like accuracy_score, precision, recall, and confusion_matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Structure
model.py: Contains the Python code for loading data, training the Logistic Regression model, and evaluating its performance.

requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python packages, including scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas.
